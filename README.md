# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the nature of a transaction based on the amount and time of the respective transaction.

The Dataset contains details of transactions and then training and testing is done over the same data on the system to check whether the trransaction is fraudulent or genuine. A Flask (Python) App is made to let users check the status of transactions.
